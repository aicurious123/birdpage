A rather secretive species of desert grasslands and coastal prairie, the [Botteri’s Sparrow](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/botteris-sparrow) is subtly plumaged in brown, rust, and tan, which helps it blend with its arid environment. A ground nester which forages exclusively on the ground for insects in summer, weed seeds in winter, Botteri’s is almost literally never seen unless singing. Difficult to identify visually and best found and identified by its “bouncing ball” song. Primarily a Mexican species with two populations, both of which barely enter the U.S.; western birds brighter than eastern birds.

WILD CARD BIRD: Keel-billed Toucan
======
The [Keel-billed Toucan](https://abcbirds.org/bird/keel-billed-toucan/) are unmistakably distinguished with their huge, rainbow-colored bills. Often seen in pairs, but not usually in groups like aracaris. Flies with a few flaps followed by a swooping glide, sometimes high over the forest canopy, and looks like a ‘flying banana.’ Heard more often than seen: ‘song’ is a far-carrying, frog-like croak, repeated steadily. Despite its large size and bright colors, can be difficult to see in leafy canopy, where it moves deliberately in search of food.


The Rules
======
1. LOOK for your daily group text which will include the Bird of the Day (sourced from [this birdwatcher's list](https://www.morgantingley.com/botd/)). The photo above will link to the Audubon Society's corresponding info page.
1. DRAW the bird. Any form, medium and interpretation is acceptable.
1. TEXT me (not the group) a photo of your bird creation by 11:59pm PT and I'll upload all photos here each night. More manageable than receiving multiple bird texts a day, and a fun way to see everyone's different styles grouped together!
1. HELP? A link to a random daily drawing tutorial will be posted simply because I need drawing help and inspiration. No need to use it. Found a cool resource? Please send it my way to share it here!
1. CONSISTENCY is key! It is more important than technique, perfection, and maybe even improvement.
1. FLEX your creativity muscle and challenge yourself to find a few (or more!) minutes every day to show up for yourself and the group!


About
======
This challenge was inspired at a watercolor class Claire and I attended in July. The instructor and her sister took up watercolors as a way to stay connected and creative during the COVID lockdown. Both nature lovers, they would take turns choosing a different bird each day to draw and share, which turned out to be a great way to stay connected to each other and also to their creative selves. Further exploration led to finding the artist [Neiko Ng](http://www.neikoart.com/blog/what-am-i-up-to) who did a similar bird-a-day personal challenge with the motto, ["A bird a day keeps depression away"](https://www.bravethewoods.com/blog/draw-a-bird-a-day-depression-goes-away#:~:text=Back%20in%20September%2C%20illustrator%20Neiko,when%20the%20art%20was%20finished) and the content creator [Struthless](https://struthless.com/pages/home) who says [drawing an ibis everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE) changed his life.
