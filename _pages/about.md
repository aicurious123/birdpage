A large, vibrantly blue bunting with a silver bill and chestnut wingbars, the male [Blue Grosbeak](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/blue-grosbeak) (Passerina caerulea) sings a rich, warbling song from trees and roadside wires. The male boasts vibrant blue plumage with chestnut wing bars, while the female is more subtly colored. He and his cinnamon-colored mate often raise two broods of nestlings in a single breeding season. As an omnivore, it feeds on insects, seeds, and fruits. With a preference for nesting low in shrubs, it often remains concealed during breeding season and can be hard to spot unless you hear them singing first. They are widespread but not abundant across the southern U.S., and are expanding their range.

Wild card: Belted Kingfisher

With its top-heavy physique, energetic flight, and piercing rattle, the [Belted Kingfisher](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/belted-kingfisher) (Megaceryle alcyon) seems to have an air of self-importance as it patrols up and down rivers and shorelines. It nests in burrows along earthen banks and feeds almost entirely on aquatic prey, diving to catch fish and crayfish with its heavy, straight bill. These ragged-crested birds are a powdery blue-gray; males have one blue band across the white breast, while females have a blue and a chestnut band. Belted Kingfishers wander widely, sometimes showing up in the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, the British Isles, the Azores, Iceland, Greenland, and the Netherlands.


Wild card: Macaroni Penguin

The [Macaroni Penguin](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/birds/penguins/macaroni_penguin.html)  (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is a striking seabird native to subantarctic and Antarctic regions. Named for its distinct yellow crest feathers that resemble the fashion of 18th-century "macaroni" dandies, it stands out among penguins. Living in colonies on rocky shores and islands, they are agile swimmers and skillful divers, hunting for krill and small fish. Despite population estimates of more than 11 million birds, macaroni penguins have experienced an estimated decline of at least 30 percent.

The Rules
======
1. LOOK for your daily group text which will include the Bird of the Day (sourced from [this birdwatcher's list](https://www.morgantingley.com/botd/)). The photo above will link to the Audubon Society's corresponding info page.
1. DRAW the bird. Any form, medium and interpretation is acceptable.
1. TEXT me (not the group) a photo of your bird creation by 11:59pm PT and I'll upload all photos here each night. More manageable than receiving multiple bird texts a day, and a fun way to see everyone's different styles grouped together!
1. HELP? A link to a random daily drawing tutorial will be posted simply because I need drawing help and inspiration. No need to use it. Found a cool resource? Please send it my way to share it here!
1. CONSISTENCY is key! It is more important than technique, perfection, and maybe even improvement.
1. FLEX your creativity muscle and challenge yourself to find a few (or more!) minutes every day to show up for yourself and the group!


About
======
This challenge was inspired at a watercolor class Claire and I attended in July. The instructor, Eileen McBride, and her sister took up watercolors as a way to stay connected during the COVID lockdown. Both nature lovers, they would take turns choosing a different bird each day to draw and share, which turned out to be a great way to stay connected to each other and also to their creative selves. Further exploration led to finding the artist [Neiko Ng](http://www.neikoart.com/blog/what-am-i-up-to) who did a similar bird-a-day personal challenge with the motto, ["A bird a day keeps depression away"](https://www.bravethewoods.com/blog/draw-a-bird-a-day-depression-goes-away#:~:text=Back%20in%20September%2C%20illustrator%20Neiko,when%20the%20art%20was%20finished) and the content creator [Struthless](https://struthless.com/pages/home) who says [drawing an ibis everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE) changed his life.
