A long-tailed, lanky songbird with a deeply curved bill, the [California Thrasher](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/california-thrasher) (Toxostoma redivivum) is a key species of California chaparral. This relative of mockingbirds is an exuberant songster, and both males and females sing from the tops of shrubs, sometimes duetting. Expert foragers, they use their bills to dig for insects and other invertebrates as is known for its ground-nesting behavior. Most live their entire lives in chaparral habitat, a plant community that has evolved with regular, intense fires during the dry months. Studies indicate that they reach their peak population densities in chaparral about 20 years after a burn. This species is on the Yellow Watch List for its restricted range.

The [Belted Kingfisher](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/belted-kingfisher)  (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is a striking seabird native to subantarctic and Antarctic regions. Named for its distinct yellow crest feathers that resemble the fashion of 18th-century "macaroni" dandies, it stands out among penguins. Living in colonies on rocky shores and islands, they are agile swimmers and skillful divers, hunting for krill and small fish. Despite population estimates of more than 11 million birds, macaroni penguins have experienced an estimated decline of at least 30 percent.

The Rules
======
1. LOOK for your daily group text which will include the Bird of the Day (sourced from [this birdwatcher's list](https://www.morgantingley.com/botd/)). The photo above will link to the Audubon Society's corresponding info page.
1. DRAW the bird. Any form, medium and interpretation is acceptable.
1. TEXT me (not the group) a photo of your bird creation by 11:59pm PT and I'll upload all photos here each night. More manageable than receiving multiple bird texts a day, and a fun way to see everyone's different styles grouped together!
1. HELP? A link to a random daily drawing tutorial will be posted simply because I need drawing help and inspiration. No need to use it. Found a cool resource? Please send it my way to share it here!
1. CONSISTENCY is key! It is more important than technique, perfection, and maybe even improvement.
1. FLEX your creativity muscle and challenge yourself to find a few (or more!) minutes every day to show up for yourself and the group!


About
======
This challenge was inspired at a watercolor class Claire and I attended in July. The instructor, Eileen McBride, and her sister took up watercolors as a way to stay connected during the COVID lockdown. Both nature lovers, they would take turns choosing a different bird each day to draw and share, which turned out to be a great way to stay connected to each other and also to their creative selves. Further exploration led to finding the artist [Neiko Ng](http://www.neikoart.com/blog/what-am-i-up-to) who did a similar bird-a-day personal challenge with the motto, ["A bird a day keeps depression away"](https://www.bravethewoods.com/blog/draw-a-bird-a-day-depression-goes-away#:~:text=Back%20in%20September%2C%20illustrator%20Neiko,when%20the%20art%20was%20finished) and the content creator [Struthless](https://struthless.com/pages/home) who says [drawing an ibis everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE) changed his life.
