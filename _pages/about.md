The [Barn Swallow](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/barn-swallow) (Hirundo rustica) is a distinctive bird recognized for its sleek, forked tail and cobalt-blue back. Found worldwide, these agile aviators inhabit open habitats like fields and barns, where they capture insects on the wing with incredible precision. Their intricate mud nests are often built in man-made structures. Migratory by nature, they undertake remarkable journeys between breeding grounds in temperate regions and wintering sites in the tropics. Barn Swallows once nested in caves throughout North America, but now build their nests almost exclusively on human-made structures.

Wild card bird: Flamingo
======

<img src="https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/manual_crop_1_91_1_1528x800/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2020-04/pixabay_pink_flamingos.jpg?itok=P1S9I0Jh">

Flamingos are iconic wading birds known for their vibrant pink plumage and distinctive long, curved necks. Found in various regions around the world, from Africa to the Americas, they thrive in shallow waters of lakes, lagoons, and salt pans. Flamingos are highly social, often seen in large flocks engaged in synchronized feeding and wading. Their unique filtering beaks help them sieve out tiny food particles from the water. Flamingos' elegant stance and enchanting presence have made them symbols of grace and beauty in the natural world.

The Rules
======
1. LOOK for your daily group text which will include the Bird of the Day (sourced from [this birdwatcher's list](https://www.morgantingley.com/botd/)). The photo above will link to the Audubon Society's corresponding info page.
1. DRAW the bird. Any form, medium and interpretation is acceptable.
1. TEXT me (not the group) a photo of your bird creation by 11:59pm PT and I'll upload all photos here each night. More manageable than receiving multiple bird texts a day, and a fun way to see everyone's different styles grouped together!
1. HELP? A link to a random daily drawing tutorial will be posted simply because I need drawing help and inspiration. No need to use it. Found a cool resource? Please send it my way to share it here!
1. CONSISTENCY is key! It is more important than technique, perfection, and maybe even improvement.
1. FLEX your creativity muscle and challenge yourself to find a few (or more!) minutes every day to show up for yourself and the group!


About
======
This challenge was inspired at a watercolor class Claire and I attended in July. The instructor and her sister took up watercolors as a way to stay connected and creative during the COVID lockdown. Both nature lovers, they would take turns choosing a different bird each day to draw and share, which turned out to be a great way to stay connected to each other and also to their creative selves. Further exploration led to finding the artist [Neiko Ng](http://www.neikoart.com/blog/what-am-i-up-to) who did a similar bird-a-day personal challenge with the motto, ["A bird a day keeps depression away"](https://www.bravethewoods.com/blog/draw-a-bird-a-day-depression-goes-away#:~:text=Back%20in%20September%2C%20illustrator%20Neiko,when%20the%20art%20was%20finished) and the content creator [Struthless](https://struthless.com/pages/home) who says [drawing an ibis everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE) changed his life.
